### **Other notes that I participated in typesetting:**  
- **MAT237**, Advanced Calculus, a short guide to theorems, lemmas and propositions. This particular set of notes was made together with [@yuchenWYC](https://github.com/yuchenWYC). [@AndyTQ](https://github.com/AndyTQ) et al. also made some useful comments for the improvment of the .tex file. They are available [here](https://github.com/yuchenWYC/MAT237). 
   

## &#x1F4BB; Typesetting in \LaTeX
Most of these notes were written with a software called TeXpad. Unfortunatelly, this brilliant application is only available on MacOS right now. But if you are using a Mac, I would highly recommend you try it out. (I was not paid by TeXpad in anyway lol. )
<details>
  <summary><b>(Legacy) Compiling with Makefile</b></summary>
  
- Compiled using ```pdflatex```:
``````
$ pdflatex --version
pdfTeX 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.20 (TeX Live 2019)
kpathsea version 6.3.1
Copyright 2019 Han The Thanh (pdfTeX) et al.   
``````  
  
- Compilation automated with ```latexmk```:
``````
$ latexmk -version
Latexmk, John Collins, 26 Dec. 2019. Version 4.67
``````  
This is particularly useful to automate the multiple runs of ```pdflatex``` needed for some documents.  
- Please note that some of these notes used the LaTeX package `minted`. To compile the documents containing `minted` using ```latexmk```, you need to use the shell escape flag. Please (create if not exist) add the following to your `~/.latexmkrc`.
``````
$latex = 'latex -interaction=nonstopmode -shell-escape';
$pdflatex = 'pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode -shell-escape';
``````  
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) is a build automation tool that automatically builds executable programs and libraries from source code by reading files called Makefiles which specify how to derive the target program. In the project, we are using it to automate the compilation of the pdf documents from the LaTeX source codes using ```pdflatex``` as well as clean up all the not needed auxilary log files.
